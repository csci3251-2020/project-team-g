# Introduction

Hi all! This is **Team G** of CSCI 3250! In the following we will be doing a few things:

1. **Start Issues**: We will be learning and practicing _issues_ on Github.
2. **Project Board**: We will be practicing functions related to _project boards_ and managing workflow.
3. **README**: Well, as your faithful IT dog, I'm currently editing this file to introduce you to the wonderful things we will be doing!
4. **README**: One more faithful IT (perhaps not) dog will be working on the below _Contributors_ section.
5. **Progress Tracking**: We will be practicing the art of _checking our progress regularly_.
6. **Github Action and C**: We will be learning and practicing deploying a simple C code to _Github Actions_ and making it work.
7. **README**: We will be practicing adding _code snippets_ from the previous task and make sure workflow badge works properly.
8. **Finishing Touches**: Finally, we will be adding a couple finishing touches to our site.
