# Task 5: Keep checking...

Your task is quite straightforward. Just keep checking...
1. Are the issues all labelled in the project?
2. Are the pull requests added in the project in proper columns?
3. Remind people to include their .md file in _stu, and their "hello" card in project

It's important to keep the community going. Enjoy!
