# Task 2: Project board

Please explore the **Projects** tab

Here is what you need to do
1. Create a new project board (with any name), and use the **Basic Kanban** template, containing *"To do"*, *"In Progress"*, and *"Done"*
2. Set up these automations:
- When pull requests are added, put the item in "In progress"
- When issues are closed, put the item in "Done"
- When pull requests are merged, put the item in "Done"
3. Add all the current issues to "To do" or appropriately in other columns
4. Regularly visit the **Issues** and **Pull requests** tabs to make sure all items are marked with your project board
5. Keep reminding people to tag their pull requests under your Project!
