# Task 1: Starting issues

Welcome to Milestone 3. You've got some group tasks to go through, and it's better to keep track with the *issues* system.

You need to do these:
1. Look at the list of items in the folder `/issues/`
2. Go to the *Issues* tab, and create a new issue for each of them the tasks using the current title and contents
3. You may create any labels if you want

That's it! Kickstart the project and ***wake your teammates up***!
