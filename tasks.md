# CSCI3251 Project Milestone #3

Welcome! You are now assigned into a team with a number of your classmates, randomly. You are not sure who are in this group, and _when_ they would start working. Now please read this document ***very carefully***. You may need to check this repo from time to time after some tasks.

## Tools to use
You may feel free to use any software (git commands, GitHub web, Atom, etc.) to interact with the system.

## Protected branch
Since the master branch is protected, you must create a pull request for every file edit, and have it reviewed by another 2 team members so that it can be merged into the master branch.
* _Some preliminary settings need to be done by the admin after the repo is created, so @chuckjee will be summoned..._

## Group tasks
- There are 8 tasks in the `issues` folder to be completed by ONE student each, in the order from 1 to 8
- **No one should do more than one task!**
- What about the late comers? The team shall figure that out
- *Remember: Everyone must contribute to review and approve the changes*

## Individual tasks for you
0. Feel free to discuss in the team discussion board inside https://github.com/orgs/csci3251-2020/teams/, owned by your team
1. In the folder **`_stu`**, create a file named `1155xxxxxx.md` (with your own SID), having the contents similar to the demo file `1155000000.md` or others if this file is removed already
2. _(After someone finishes Task 2)_  
Under the **Projects** tab of your team, in the project board, create a new card under **To do** and introduce yourself
3. If you want to work on that issue, assign yourself to this issue and make a comment there so there is no competetion among team members
4. After you are done, assign another 2 team members that can help you double check (but **not** @chuckjee), or you may need to wait when more people join your team
5. Be an effective and efficient reviewer
6. Put down proper comments in every request, review and approval
7. When you consider all your individual work done, please go to the **Projects** board and move your hello card (step 2 above) to **Done**

## Reviewing
- There may be a lot of review requests of issues and pull requests (when people are adding files), so keep an eye on the **Pull requests** and **Issues** for any assigned reviews in the top GitHub menu
- If requested, please carefully check the relevant tasks if they are done well, and choose to **Comment**, **Approve**, or **Request changes**
- After checking that an issue is done correctly, you can close it (_with comments_)
- After reviewing that a pull request is okay to merge, merge it and close the request (_with comments_)

## Workload constraints
- Part of your work is graded individually, but mainly collectively as a team
- Your contributions to the 8 issues, reviews, and discussions will be considered in grading
- Every student should work on **no more than ONE** issue
- Every student should work on **more than ONE** reviews
- Since some issues may not be done yet when you join, you may have to "watch" the repo so that you come back later to finish all your individual tasks

## Questions?
- In issues or pull requests, just summon @chuckjee for any questions
- You may also post in the Students team discussion (https://github.com/orgs/csci3251-2020/teams/students)

## Submission deadline
Everything will be finalised by **May 8 (Fri) 23:59**  
* Yes, this deadline includes Milestones 1 and 2
